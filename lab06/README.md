# Lab06: PHP

## 1) Explain what each of your classes and methods does, the order in which methods are invoked, and the flow of execution after one of the operation buttons has been clicked.



## 2) Also explain how the application would differ if you were to use $_GET, and why this may or may not be preferable.



## 3) Finally, please explain whether or not there might be another (better +/-) way to determine which button has been pressed and take the appropriate action

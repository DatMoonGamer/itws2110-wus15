# Quiz 01

## Choices made

### Inclusion of slideshow
A preview of every item available on the menu

### Using one column
I originally intended to use two columns to display menu items, but decided it would complicate the field of view for the user and would take a long time to implement.

### Duck logo
Duck :)

### Color scheme, rounded buttons
Red-pink to induce hunger, yellow for warmth, combined in a gradient to make the site vibrant and visually appealing
Round boxes are considered more inviting

### Website name
Henbang means "very good" in Chinese
